# Blokur Developer

At [Blokur](https://www.blokur.com/) we are building a new system of record for music rights data to make sure that whenever a song is played, the right person gets paid.

This GitHub repository captures some artifacts that we think can be valuable to the music publishing ecosystem.


## Music Publishing Rights Schema  

Our `JSON` schema (v1.0) for publishing rights information  is now open source. The schema facilitates the exchange of publishing rights for musical works.
